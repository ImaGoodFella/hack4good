Here are some resources that Koen and I discussed yesterday, which you may use to get and process the remote sensing and meteorological data.

- ERA5 reanalysis weather data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form
- Sentinel-2 remote sensing data: https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products
- Koen's repository containing code to get the data (for an old version of the extended images dataset): https://github.com/khufkens/eyes_on_the_ground
