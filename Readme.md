# IFPRI Hack4Good

## Project Title: 
#### Duration: Oct 6 - November 22, 2023
#### Team: 
**Students:** Rahul Steiger, Flavia, Roman, Jan Wenkel\
**Mentor:** Lionel Trebuchon\
**Hack4Good project responsible:** Pepa Aran\
**IFPRI contact person:** Koen Hufkens

### What is Hack4Good?

Hack4Good is a 8-week long pro-bono program that matches data science talents from ETH Zurich with non-profit organisations that promote social causes. In close collaboration with such a non-profit, small student teams develop and implement data-driven solutions to increase these organizations' impact.

### What is IFPRI?


### Project Context

#### Data under NDA

#### Ressources
Paper from Koen Hufkens. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318303484 

Here are some resources to get and process the remote sensing and meteorological data.

- ERA5 reanalysis weather data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form
- Sentinel-2 remote sensing data: https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products
- Koen's repository containing code to get the data (for an old version of the extended images dataset): https://github.com/khufkens/eyes_on_the_ground

### Goals

1. **Prediction of the type of damage done to a crop type**\
See definition by 

2. **Prediction of the severity of the damage**\

### Deliverables
TODO
- Pure image prediction using the pre-trained convnext (newer resnet50) or similar model?
- Separate weather feature prediction
- Combining the two?
- Model (kedro + mlflow?)
- Report (who will read it?)
- Presentation Hack4Good
